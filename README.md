# Unit Testing with JSON in C#

## Overview

This repository showcases how integrating JSON and streamlined classes can significantly enhance C# unit tests. This method simplifies test data management, making our tests more adaptable and sharply focused on testing logic.

## Features

- **Simplified Test Data Management**: Leverage JSON to easily configure and modify test scenarios without changing the test code.
- **Increased Test Adaptability**: Rapidly adjust and extend testing scenarios to cover a broader range of logic and use cases.
- **Focus on Logic**: Maintain clean and focused unit tests that prioritize verifying code logic, enhancing readability and maintainability.

## Getting Started
